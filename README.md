# PomodoroApp
Version of a Pomodoro App as a part of the App Brewery Python Bootcamp 2021.

I've added some upgraded features with respect to the original project in the course.
The main custom feature is a winding up animation and sounds for the timer as well as a bell to
make it feel like a real pomodoro timer. The start/reset buttons have been merged into one to make it simpler and because they are mutually exclusive.
