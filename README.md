# PomodoroApp
Version of a Pomodoro App as a part of the [App Brewery Python Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

I've added some upgraded features with respect to the original project in the course.
The main custom feature is a winding up animation and sounds for the timer as well as a bell to
make it feel like a real pomodoro timer, togheter with a mute/unmute button. The start/reset buttons have been merged into one to make it simpler because they are mutually exclusive. Finally a pomodoro counter has been added to keep track of the pomodoros completed (4 work periods of 25 min) up to 7 pomodoros when the app advises the user to go sleep (+8 hours of work).

The app is originally inspired by the Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo, a time management technique to improve workflow habits and information retention.
